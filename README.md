# US-Environmental-Protection-Agency(EPA)/Sea-Level-Predictor
In this project I worked with Python, Pandas module. 
Firstly I created a scatterplot based on the year and adjusted sea level data.
Than I used Linear Regression plot with red line between the years 1880 & 2050.
Finally I just added the second line with green color, based on data only for 2000 & 2050.
With the plot graph, we can see the results of climate change so far and its predicted effects on humanity.
